## Description

This model demonstrates animated rigging with three different animation cycles: Survey, Walk, and Run.  These animations all drive the same joints, so for this model, only one animation should be active at any given time.  glTF [specifies](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#animations) that the client implementation may choose when to play any of the available animations.
